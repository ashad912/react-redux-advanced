// Token 

// Have to manually wire up
// Can be sent to any domain

// Cookie
// Automatically included on all requests

// Cannot to be sent to different domains - cannot be hijacked easily

// bcrypt can hash pasword by auto-salt or generated-salt on separate function call

// When we use generated-salt, encrypted password in db holds salt and hashed password

// Salt is a key. Remember, bcrypt compares password only in hashed strategies

// Passport has own ecosystem in node environment

// Passport strategies
// #1 - Verify user with a JWT
// #2 - Verify user with a username and password

// Used JWT for get endpoint
// Used local strategy to get sign in (middleware for comparing passwords)

// Local strategy need proper options: usernameField !
