// fieldset tag draws a box around the related elements

// Redux form work with classical mapping to props
// To use hooks, we need additional plugin ex. "react-hook-form"

// const func = () => {}
// const func2 = () => {}

// onClick={func(func2)} doest not invoke func2 immediately (func does), because it's reference

// In Redux, actions funnels (leją się, rz. lejek) to middleware and then to reducers

// Action creator -> Action -> Dispatch 'funnel' -> Middleware -> Reducers


// CORS error (does not appear with proxy package.json setting)
// Cross Origin Resource Sharing
// Cannot send request from external domain
// Browser checks if domain, subdomain or port of requests are different
// If are, CORS comes to play
// Browser send query to server, if is allowed to send requests from others domain?
// Server respond, according to its CORS config
// Browser presents the respond results to JS / user
// You cannot (in no-hacky way) disable CORS in any browser!!!
// CORS is browser mechanism 

// What about Postman?
// Postman does not care! Postman has not got CORS implemented!!!
