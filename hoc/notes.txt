// Passing props to Route component (React Browser Router): https://ui.dev/react-router-v4-pass-props-to-components/

// File named in lowercase - by convention it has to export default function
// File named in upperrcase - by convention it has to export default class

// scaffold - rusztowanie

// When we create HOC, we can attach mapStateToProps/mapDispatchToProps functions to WrappedComponent or HOC function itself.

// Another HOC approach: export ... requireAuth(CommentBox)
// Usually used as <Route ... component={requireAuth(CommentBox)}
